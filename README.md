# C-square
 *Hello Guys!*

 Today, i'm here to share with you a code that I writed to do a exercise of my college's activites, which was proposed create a square according the number which the user entered. Has two square type's, the first is a full square, and second, is a empty square.

 I took, more or less, 4 hours to write this code correctly. So, at the moment, i'm waiting for professor's correction, for then, improve my skills if something is wrong.
